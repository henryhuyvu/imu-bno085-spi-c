This repo was an attempt at C programming for a Raspberry Pi Pico to interface with the BNO085 IMU to capture and display IMU data. 

While it was interested exploring this low-leve language, my impatience and desire to get working software led me to ultimately shift towards I2C communications via Python, which was significantly easier to achieve.
